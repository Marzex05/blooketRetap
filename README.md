# Blooket Bot (Hobby Project)

## Overview  
This project is a simple bot designed to join Blooket games automatically. It is meant to handle game authentication, connects to Firebase (Firebase endpoint remains unresolved), and (supposed to) update the game state in real time. The bot simulates a player joining a game and interacting with the Firebase database.

## Current Status  
üö® **This script is currently non-functional.** The main Firebase connection is missing in the `fetch` command, preventing it from retrieving the necessary authentication token to join games. It is commented in the code, but can also be found on line [ADD LINE] if no more commits are made.
 
‚ö†Ô∏è **This script has CORS issues**, which will not be resolved unless you use a no-cors parameter for fetch or run this in a related Blooket page.

## How It Works  
- Sends a request to join a Blooket game using a game ID and player name.  
- Connects to Firebase using a provided authentication token.  
- Updates the game state in Firebase to reflect the bot‚Äôs presence.  
- Listens for real-time updates to game data.

## Future Development  
This is a **hobby project** and likely **won't be actively developed further**. However, anyone interested in understanding how Blooket's game connection works can explore and build upon it.
